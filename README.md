 ## Ability of Soccer players – Who is the best for the buck

  Soccer is the biggest sport in the world. Millions across the world spend time and money in the pursuit of it, whether it be watching it in coffee shops, playing recreationally at their local soccer club, or placing bets in the fantasy leagues. The big question that many larger soccer clubs often ask themselves, knowingly or not, is who best to let go, and who best to keep. This question while never easy, has been made easier by the efforts of our team. 

## Why this specific topic

  We understand at the end of the day, a team is only as good as its whole, and if a player is taking resources from the team that would be better be used elsewhere, then the whole team suffers. So, this brough us to the big question, does a player’s cost correlate to their performance. This is the main question that we will be asking, and using FIFA data, we will look at the cost of the player and compare their overall attributes. This is what we will look at in this analysis and create a machine learning model to judge whether or the pay really does correlate to performance, and if not, we can then present to the client recommendation on how best to optimize the performance of the team by adding or removing certain players.

  This is of interest for many parties, key of those as previously mentioned, are these large football clubs. Expense can be easily upwards of 200k a year for a single player, and these expenses just like another business expense must be mitigated whenever possible. This is where our program will come it. With our dataset of FIFA players, we will target our variables of interest and create a data-frame out of them. This will then be place on a server, then from their fed into our machine learning algorithm who will parse through the data and generate expected values and compare them to real values. Our null hypothesis would be that there is no correlation between earnings and performance on the field. Our alternative hypothesis would be that there is a correlation, and by using figures we can determine whether or not that correlation is positive or negative. 

 ## Methods of communication and Cooperation 

One of the key requirements in any successful project is a team which communicates and cooperates effectively. Large tasks such as this require everyone to work together to make sure that the client receives the desired outcome on time and without delays. We have put a lot of thought into how during the span of this project we will be communicating and sharing our progress on our respective parts of the project, to this end we created a Discord server. This is where the bulk of our communications takes places as discord is a platform which allows for file sharing, video or voice calling, chat logs and chat history to be saved. This allows us to rapid share files to the whole group and actively talk while working on our tasks. Another method we are using to keep up communication between the team is daily meetings to update us and discuss openly any concerns we face individually or collectively. For example, if one of us finds a specific aspect of the project challenging or cannot complete a task on time, our daily meetings will allow us to redistribute tasks and solve our issues so that we can collectively move forward. We feel that using this method would allow us to “square the circle” between Agile and Waterfall method. In addition, we plan to communicate our work process to the client by providing a log of the discoveries made and plan changes to our project. This will ensure transparency with all parties and will be available in a section of the README. This allows interested parties to keep up with advancements of the project as well as the thoughts of the team.

## In Closing

We know that with a well laid plan, we can achieve the desired goal on time, and get the answers to the stack holders. Putting together machine learning, thoughtful insights, story driven data, and a well-organized team, we know that we will be able to deliver on our goal, of finding what indicators to look for, to find the true monetary value of a player.
