## Presentation

### Selected Topic

**Machine Learning Question:** Are certain player atributes in football more important in determining a players actual Market Value (value_euro)?    
-	The Target variable for the machine learning model will be the Market Value of the player which is specified in the value_euro column of our dataset
-	Our data source is a CSV file with 18000 rows of player information and 90 columns of different statistics and information

**Business Question/Solution:** By analyzing athletes as sports analysts, can we advise teams on which players add most value to the team based on their performance in comparison to their market value?

### Reason Why We Selected This Topic

We selected this topic as sports such as a whole have a lot of statistics including Football/Soccer. We as a team wanted to see if there is a trend between performance statistics and the market value of a player. Which categories are most important in determining a playerâ€™s market value?
If we can answer these questions with our model, we could potentially start a start-up sports analytics firm which would provide football clubs with information of which players are worth purchasing based off of not only their performance but the value they add to the team and if that market value is worth paying.

### Questions to Answer with Data
1.	Can we create a supervised learning model which provides us with information which players performance are closer to their actual market value?
2.	Which statistical categories are most important in deciding performance of a player actually gives a certain player a higher value (is it speed, stamina, goal scoring etc.)?
3.	BONUS QUESTION: Is a player worth their market value? Or is a player overpaid/underpaid based off of their performance?
