## Tableau

We are using Tableau Public to create visualizations that are easy to read and understand.
Tableau will help us to have some insights and questions about our dataset, at the first point we used the insights and shared with our team to discuss what we could do next,
and then we will make decisions and work on our ETL process. 

After some data transformation, we can reload the dataset and create more dashboards and stories to tell a bit more of our findings and convince the decision-makers with our analysis. 

- This initial dashboard allows us to interpret the data with numbers such as Total of players, grouped quantity by nationality filtered above 100 players.  

A chart of Player's Position brings attention to some data transformation that will have many categories that we should resume in the most important ones.

- Player's Overall Ratings can present to us the player's score, but again the many positions may affect our Machine Learning model to predict and answer our main question.
That will lead us to categorize this column and proceed with our data Extract Transform and Load process.
