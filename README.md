## Machine Learning 
We intend to use a Supervised Machine Learning model, specifically a linear regression model. We have a clear research question, and know that using our historical data of players performances we can uncover if there is a relationship a player’s value and their performance. Their value in Euros (a continuous variable) would be the target variable or dependent x variable. We’ll analyze many different independent of y variables or features that our model will learn from. 

### Technical Set Up 
To build and execute this model we will be using the Scikit-learn machine learning library from Python and specifically have to import the Linear Regression module.
