## Tableau

We are using Tableau Public to create visualizations that are easy to read and understand.
Tableau will help ups to have some insights and questions about our dataset, at the first point we used the insights and shared with our team to discuss what we could do next,
and them we will make decisions and work on our ETL process. 

After some data transformation we can reload dataset and create more dashboards and story to tell a bit more of our findings and convince the decision makers with our analysis. 

- This inicial dashboard allow us to interpret the data with numbers such us Total of players, grouped quantity by nationality filtered above 100 players.  

A chart of Players Position brings the attention for some data transformation that wil have many categories that we should resume in the most important ones.

- Players Overal Ratings can present us the players score, but again the many positions may affect our Machine Learning model to predict adn answer our main question. 
That will lead us to categorize this column and proceed with our data Extract Transform and Load process.
