## Machine Learning 
We intend to use a Supervised Machine Learning model, specifically a linear regression model. We have a clear research question, and know that by using our historical data of players performance we can uncover if there is a relationship between a player’s value and their performance. Their value in Euros (a continuous variable) would be the target variable or dependent X variable. We’ll analyze many different independent Y variables or features that our model will learn from. The exact variables will be uncovered during our exploratory analysis but some possible examples are stamina, endurance, balance, ball control, etc.    

### Technical Set Up 
To build and execute this model we will be using the Scikit-learn machine learning library from Python and specifically have to import the Linear Regression module.
