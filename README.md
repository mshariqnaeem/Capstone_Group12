 ## Ability of Soccer players – Who is the best for the buck

  Soccer is the biggest sport in the world. Millions across the world spend time and money in the pursuit of it, whether it be watching it in coffee shops, playing recreationally at their local soccer club, or placing bets in the fantasy leagues. The big question that many larger soccer clubs often ask themselves, knowingly or not, is who best to let go, and who best to keep. This question while never easy, has been made easier by the efforts of our team. 

## Why this specific topic

  We understand at the end of the day, a team is only as good as its whole, and if a player is taking resources from the team that would be better be used elsewhere, then the whole team suffers. So, this brough us to the big question, does a player’s cost correlate to their performance. This is the main question that we will be asking, and using FIFA data, we will look at the cost of the player and compare it to what we feel Is important, their handling of the ball. This is what we will look at in this analysis and create a machine learning model to judge whether or the pay really does correlate to performance, and if not, we can then present to the client recommendation on how best to optimize the performance of the team by adding or removing certain players.

  This is of interest for many parties, key of those as previously mentioned, are these large football clubs. Expense can be easily upwards of 200k a year for a single player, and these expenses just like another business expense must be mitigated whenever possible. This is where our program will come it. With our dataset of FIFA players, we will target our variables of interest and create a data-frame out of them. This will then be place on a server, then from their fed into our machine learning algorithm who will parse through the data and generate expected values and compare them to real values. Our null hypothesis would be that there is no correlation between earnings and performance on the field. Our alternative hypothesis would be that there is a correlation, and by using figures we can determine whether or not that correlation is positive or negative.
